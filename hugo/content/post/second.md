A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didnâ€™t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their
agency, where they abused her for their.
